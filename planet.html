                        Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. Known as an "ice giant," it is a massive planet primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and traces of methane, which gives it its distinctive blue hue. Neptune has a thick atmosphere filled with dynamic weather systems, including some of the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph). Beneath its atmosphere lies a mantle of water, ammonia, and methane ices, surrounding a rocky core.
                        Neptune's average distance from the Sun is about 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles), and it takes 164.8 Earth years to complete one orbit. Despite being far from the Sun, it generates more heat than it receives, hinting at an internal heat source.
                        Neptune has 14 known moons, with the largest being Triton, a geologically active moon with icy volcanoes. The planet also has faint rings made of dust and ice particles, which are difficult to observe from Earth.

                            Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun, orbiting at an average distance of 57.9 million kilometers (36 million miles). Despite its diminutive size, just slightly larger than Earth's Moon, Mercury is incredibly dense, with a large metallic core that constitutes most of its volume. This rocky planet has no atmosphere, only a thin exosphere composed of atoms ejected by solar wind and meteoroid impacts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The planet's surface is heavily cratered and marked by vast plains and towering cliffs known as scarps, which formed as Mercury's core cooled and shrank. One of its most remarkable features is the Caloris Basin, a massive impact crater surrounded by mountain ranges. Mercury's lack of a substantial atmosphere causes extreme temperature variations, with daytime highs reaching 430°C (800°F) and nighttime lows plunging to -180°C (-290°F).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mercury completes a year in just 88 Earth days, making it the fastest-orbiting planet. However, its slow rotation (59 Earth days) and elliptical orbit result in a solar day lasting 176 Earth days. Despite its proximity to the Sun, ice exists in permanently shadowed craters at its poles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Observed since ancient times, Mercury was named after the Roman messenger god for its swift movements across the sky. It has been studied up close by missions like Mariner 10 and MESSENGER, and further exploration is underway with ESA and JAXA's BepiColombo mission. As a planet of extremes, Mercury offers a unique glimpse into the Solar System's origins and the challenges of existing so close to the Sun.

It is a cold, rocky desert world with surface features reminiscent of both Earth and the Moon. Mars boasts the tallest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and the largest canyon, Valles Marineris. Its thin atmosphere, composed mostly of carbon dioxide, cannot support liquid water on the surface today, but evidence suggests that water once flowed on Mars in ancient rivers and lakes. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are irregularly shaped and believed to be captured asteroids.

                        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, a gas giant with a unique blue-green color due to methane in its atmosphere. It rotates on its side, making its axial tilt the most extreme of any planet in the solar system. Uranus has a faint ring system and 27 known moons. Its atmosphere is mostly hydrogen, helium, and methane.

                        Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant with a bluish-green hue due to methane in its atmosphere. It has a unique axial tilt of 98 degrees, causing it to rotate on its side. This means that one pole points toward the Sun for half of its orbit, leading to extreme seasonal variations. Uranus’s atmosphere contains hydrogen, helium, and methane, with icy components in its interior. It has faint rings and 27 known moons, including Miranda, which has a surface marked by extreme geological features.

                            <br>Trivia: <br>
                            Uranus was the first planet discovered with a telescope, by William Herschel in 1781.<br>

                            It is the coldest planet in the Solar System, with temperatures dropping to -357°F (-224°C).<br>

                            Its tilted magnetic field does not align with its rotational axis, creating complex magnetosphere dynamics.<br>
